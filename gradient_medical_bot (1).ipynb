For example:\\nAllergens that are breathed in often cause a stuffy nose, itchy nose and throat, mucus production, cough, or wheezing. Allergens that touch the eyes may cause itchy, watery, red, swollen eyes. Eating something you are allergic to can cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, cramping, diarrhea, or a severe, life-threatening reaction. Allergens that touch the skin can cause a skin rash, hives, itching, blisters, or even skin peeling. Drug allergies usually involve the whole body and can lead to a variety of symptoms.'}, {'inputs': '### Instruction: What causes Allergy?\\n\\n### Response:The immune system normally protects the body against harmful substances, such as bacteria and viruses. It also reacts to foreign substances called allergens, which are generally harmless and in most people do not cause a problem.But in a person with allergies, the immune response is oversensitive. When it recognizes an allergen, it releases chemicals such as histamines. which fight off the allergen. This causes itching, swelling, mucus production, muscle spasms, hives, rashes, and other symptoms, which vary from person to person.\\nCommon allergens include pollen, mold, pet dander, and dust. Food and drug allergies are common. Allergic reactions can also be caused by insect bites, jewelry, cosmetics, spices, and other substances.Some people have allergy-like reactions to hot or cold temperatures, sunlight, or other environmental triggers.\\nSometimes, friction (rubbing or roughly stroking the skin) will cause symptoms.A specific allergy is not usually passed down through families (inherited). However, if both your parents have allergies, you are likely to have allergies. The chance is greater if your mother has allergies.\\nAllergies may make certain medical conditions such as sinus problems, eczema, and asthma worse.Allergies are relatively common. Both genetics and environmental factors play a role.'}, {'inputs': '### Instruction: When to seek urgent medical care when I have Allergy ?\\n\\n### Response:Call for an appointment with your health care provider if:\\nSevere symptoms of allergy occur. Treatment for allergies no longer works.'}, {'inputs': '### Instruction: What to expect if I have Allergy  (Outlook/Prognosis)?\\n\\n### Response:Most allergies can be easily treated with medication. Some children may outgrow an allergy. This is particularly true of food allergies. However, as a general rule, once a substance has triggered an allergic reaction, it continues to affect the person.\\nAllergy shots are most effective when used to treat those with hay fever symptoms and severe insect sting allergies. They are not used to treat food allergies because of the danger of a severe reaction. Allergy shots may require years of treatment, but they work in most cases. However, they may cause uncomfortable side effects (such as hives and rash) and dangerous outcomes (such as anaphylaxis).'}, {'inputs': '### Instruction: What are the symptoms of Anaphylaxis?\\n\\n### Response:Symptoms develop rapidly, often within seconds or minutes. They may include the following:\\nAbdominal pain or cramping Abnormal (high-pitched) breathing sounds Anxiety Confusion Cough Diarrhea Difficulty breathing Difficulty swallowing Fainting, light-headedness, dizziness Hives, itchiness Nasal congestion Nausea, vomiting Palpitations Skin redness Slurred speech Wheezing'}]\n"
